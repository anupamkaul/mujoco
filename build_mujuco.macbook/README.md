This folder is the build artifacts on my macbook of the open source mujoco code directly
(i.e. https://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco)

FROM contains the build instructions page

It took less than 10 minutes to build the entire source code on my macbook first attempt!
(Compared to days it took for me to set my env on Linux and get the build working)
